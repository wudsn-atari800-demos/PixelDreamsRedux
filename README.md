# Pixel Dreams Redux by Bohemian Grove and JAC!

A demake of the Atari STE demo [Pixel Dreams by Bohemian Grove](https://demozoo.org/productions/355398/) for the Atari 8-bit comptuer line.
Created for and released at [Silly Venture 2k24 WE](https://demozoo.org/parties/4780/).

The demo uses 2 MB Megacart cartride and requires 64k of RAM. It comes in two variants. The preferred variant uses a COVOX extension to perform 8-bit sample replay. This version provides the best sound quality. If you do not have a COVOX extension, you can chose the variant that performs 4-bit sample replay via the builtin POKEY chip.
